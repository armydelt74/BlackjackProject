## Blackjack Project
Week 5 Homework for Skill Distillery


### Overview
Blackjack Application Overview:

Deck, Card, Suites rank Rank:
Kept enumerating class for card suites and rankings  that mimics a deck of cards. Created Deck class that instantiates array of 52 unique cards and then randomly shuffles them

Abstract Hand, Blackjack Hand:
Created Abstract Hand class to allow two hands of cards - one to a Dealer and another to a Player. Both player and dealer are allowed to add cards in turn with rules of blackjack.
Dealer must decide to Hit or Stay based on the rules of Blackjack: if the Dealer's hand total is below 17, the Dealer must Hit; if the hand total is 17 or above, the Dealer must Stay.

Methods():

Logic:

### Topics and Concepts Covered
Array instantiation, passing methods, calling methods.
List Array/String Array; Super/sub Class & inheritance; UML project creation.
Building classes in an Object-Oriented manner.
Building classes whose fields are Objects.
Use collection types to organize and manage data.
Use conditionals to create game logic.

#### Lessons Learned
Do more ahead of time build out detailed UML with logical path for abstract class
extension and method calls from one class to another
